# Song Recommendation System 

This project is a song recommendation system built in Python, designed for my A-Level Computer Science NEA. The system recommends songs to users based on their preferences, integrating with the Spotify API and using Last.fm for genre-based recommendations. It also includes features like generating user statistics, creating playlists, and managing song recommendations.

## Features

- **Spotify Integration**: Fetch user statistics using the Spotify Web API and the built-in python library **Spotipy**
- **Song Recommendations**: Provide complex recommendation algorithms.
- **Playlist Creation**: Add playlists into Spotify library in real-time.
- **User Interface**: A user-friendly GUI built using Tkinter for simple interaction with the system.
- **YouTube Integration**: Upload playlists of recommendations into YouTube to display music videos.

## A level NEA Details

- **Centre Number**: 20570
- **Candidate Number**: 4843

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that the `.env` file is added to your `.gitignore` to prevent your sensitive API credentials from being tracked by version control.
- If you're unsure about the Spotify API credentials, follow the instructions in the [Spotify Developer documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) to set up your app and obtain the required keys.
